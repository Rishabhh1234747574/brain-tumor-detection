# brain-tumor-detection
This Java-based project aims to develop an application for the automatic detection of brain tumors from MRI scans using basic image processing techniques. The system utilizes core Java functionalities alongside image processing libraries (like OpenCV with JavaCV or Java AWT/Swing for GUI) to analyze MRI images and identify potential tumor regions.
